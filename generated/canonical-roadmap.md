## Sprint 42 — Hosted Governed Execution Runtime

- ID: `NKS-SPR-042`
- Status: `complete`
- Objective: Deploy and validate the complete Enki governed mutation path in the authorized hosted runtime so no canonical mutation can bypass context, authority, policy, provenance, reservation, journaling, receipts, and recovery.
- Work items: BL-042
- Evidence records: 6

Exit criteria:

- Hosted requests resolve exact context before authority or mutation evaluation
- Every canonical mutation passes authority, policy, provenance, reservation, journal, and receipt controls
- Duplicate, delayed, interrupted, and conflicting operations converge or fail closed
- Hosted retries cannot duplicate canonical effects or consume authority twice
- Failure recovery reconstructs exact state and evidence lineage
- TEST execution remains incapable of production effects unless separately authorized

## Sprint 43 — Hosted Retrieval and Knowledge Access

- ID: `NKS-SPR-043`
- Status: `planned`
- Objective: Operationalize current-authority, historical, contextual, structured, semantic, and projection access against the hosted governed state without leaking authority or converting projections into canonical truth.
- Work items: BL-043
- Evidence records: 0

Exit criteria:

- Hosted consumers can explicitly request current-authority, historical, and as-of views
- Tenant, subject, domain, audience, purpose, privacy, and provenance filters are enforced server-side
- Structured and semantic retrieval remain deterministic within declared contracts
- Projections and interpretations remain noncanonical absent separate governed promotion
- Pagination, stale-state, denial, replay, and leakage paths are validated
- Model access continues through the governed provider-neutral model gateway

## Sprint 44 — Disaster Recovery, Portability, and Provider Exit

- ID: `NKS-SPR-044`
- Status: `complete`
- Objective: Prove that hosted Enki can be backed up, exported, reconstructed, restored, and migrated without permanent dependence on the selected provider combination or loss of authority semantics.
- Work items: BL-044
- Evidence records: 5

Exit criteria:

- Structured state and object evidence have coordinated backup and recovery procedures
- Point-in-time and clean-room reconstruction preserve exact canonical fingerprints and receipts
- Provider outage and provider-exit scenarios have tested recovery paths
- Exports remain open, deterministic, hash-bound, and independently verifiable
- Rollback and migration preserve authority, lineage, policy, consent, and temporal semantics
- Provider loss cannot silently convert projections, caches, or replicas into canonical authority

## Sprint 45 — Production-Control Implementation

- ID: `NKS-SPR-045`
- Status: `planned`
- Objective: Implement and validate the seven Sprint 35 production-control contracts against the human-authorized hosted architecture using qualifying production-scope evidence and independent assessment where required.
- Work items: BL-045
- Evidence records: 0

Exit criteria:

- Cloud IAM is validated with least-privilege and denial evidence
- Production identity federation is validated with forged, expired, revoked, and wrong-audience denial paths
- Managed database row-level isolation and network segmentation are validated in production scope
- Per-tenant production keys and production secrets management are validated for rotation, revocation, and leakage resistance
- Independent penetration testing is performed by an authorized independent assessor

- Evidence records: 5

Exit criteria:

- Metrics, traces, structured logs, and health indicators use bounded metadata and stable correlation identifiers
- Protected canonical content, secrets, and disallowed personal data never enter telemetry
- Queue pressure, saturation, latency, failure, retry, recovery, and provider degradation are observable
- Incident records reconstruct exact operation, authority, evidence, and recovery lineage without widening disclosure
- Telemetry loss, duplication, ordering gaps, and correlation mismatch are detectable
- Observability and incident tooling cannot mutate canonical state or authorize recovery effects

## Sprint 47 — Multi-Product Hosted Integration

- Evidence records: 5

Exit criteria:

- All three product suites use versioned hosted Enki consumer contracts
- Concurrent hosted workloads preserve tenant, subject, domain, audience, purpose, and product isolation
- Media Blitz publication paths, Career external-action paths, and Personal Cognitive Continuity human controls remain independently governed
- One product failure or overload cannot widen another product authority or corrupt canonical state
- Cross-product observability remains privacy-preserving and attributable

- Known limitations, accepted findings, support obligations, rollback, migration, and independent-review requirements are explicit
- Missing, failed, deferred, or conditional evidence remains distinguishable
- The package supports APPROVE, APPROVE WITH CONDITIONS, DEFER, and REJECT
- Only explicit human launch authority can authorize operational production launch
